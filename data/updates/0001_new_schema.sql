Make a reservation when you are planning to use tables or equipment.  Reservations help us track usage and more importantly make sure equipment and tables are not double booked. 

Clean up after yourself.  We need everyone to plan for an appropriate amount of time to clean up after themselves to leave things cleaner than you found them.  This applies to specific areas as well as project storage. 

Thank you,
